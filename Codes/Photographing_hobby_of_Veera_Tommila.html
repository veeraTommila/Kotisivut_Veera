         	 <tr> As a child, I was afraid of cameras, because there were noisy film cameras in my childhood. My first own camera was a film camera too and I got it in my 10s for a Christmas present in 2002. It collapsed at the end of spring 2003, because a piece of sand or something else broke the lens cover. I got a digital pocket camera of Kodak as an appliance of the copy machine of my father few years after. Before that I took some photos with my parent’s pocket film camera. I still remember, what sounds the camera made when I took the photos and it wound some film.
         	 
         	 <td>I took my first <strong>digital photos</strong>. It was a bit odd, when one <em>could</em> take more than 24 photos and one could even delete these before have the photos developed. I still get my first digital photos saved both in hard drives and albums. Here is one photograph of a cake covered with melted white chocolate. 
         	 
         	 <td> I had Canon Digital Ixus-modelled digicameras for many years. During my teenages I took some photos of me wearing kimono in different postures. On that time I did not have a stative for camera, that’s why I had piled some of my photo albums on my desktop/table and put my camera on them to take photos by a self-timer. Once the pile of albums fell down and the camera fell on the floor and the shutters of the camera collapsed. Inspite of that it was possible to take photos with that camera. Otherwise it was wiser to by a brand new camera.
         	 
         	 <td>I am weared in a proper kimono made of silk. This photograph has been taken during the years 2007 and 2008. On that time, I only knew that one uses underwear kimono (nagajuban) under the kimono and one ties the left side over right. If the right side is on: you are a dead body. In the Japanese funeral, the deceased has the kimono worn like right over left and the others on the other way around.

         	 <td>I got my camera stand / stative on spring 2008. My next camera collapsed in December of 2008 by pressing accidently the shutter button when the camera was connected to my laptop. The next camera after that was acquired on spring 2009 and I still have it. Unfortunately, I haven’t used it for years. Despite that it still functions. This Christmasful photo is taken by me at my sister’s in Éspiet, the countryside of south-western France at Christmas 2011.
         	 
         	 <td>I got my very first mobile phone with camera on March 2012. That was my first smart phone too. My previous was from the year 2004 and that was just a normal mobile phone without even a color screen. These are multiplied flowers of a cherry tree in Lauttasaari of Helsinki.
         	 
         	 <td>In December 2012, I got my Canon 600D, the very first digital system camera of mine. I started my studies of graphic design’s field in Varia the vocational school of Vantaa after my matriculation examinations. There was taken lots of photos by digital system camera and that’s why it was necessary. The first RAW-photos were taken at a Japanese tearoom called Tokuyuuan in Suomenlinna and on the hills of Koli on December 2012.
