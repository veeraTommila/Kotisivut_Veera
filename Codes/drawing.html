          <p class="kappale">I have drawn since a small child; as long as I could remember. My first drawings were ordinary messy circles of children. I remember in my 2:s and 3:s mess the walls of my childhood room with chalks before I learned to draw some clear characters. My mother told me that my first proper drawing was a cat family, that I draw on a chalkboard in one waiting room in the Aurooran sairaala-hospital at the same age. As an elder child I draw a lot of animal characters: especially dolphins and whales. At school age I started to draw human characters too. Some of my human characters don’t look like a human at all. There are “Nomi to Sini Noki no hanashi” -cartoon characters of mine for example.</p>
          <p class="kappale">A couple of pages from my ”Nomi to Sini Noki no hanashi”-cartoon. Unfortunately the pages are in Finnish.</p>
